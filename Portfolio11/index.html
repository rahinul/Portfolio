                            <p>Since 1995 Alex has served as the President & CEO of AltaPacific, Inc. <br/> overseeing offices in California and Texas. He led the company through the <br/> tech boom but always prepared our team for the inevitable bubble burst,
                                <br/> which we survived, when most didn’t. His business acumen is among the <br/> highest in the nation. He’s a great leader, (he’s going to hate that I said <br/> that, but it’s true). A better leader would be hard to find.</p><br/>

                            <p> Prior to 1995, he was the Operations Controller/Submarine Engineer and <br/> Pilot for SubSea Offshore, Ltd based in Aberdeen, Scotland 1988-1995. His <br/> international business experience is invaluable in the new Green Rush.
                                His
                                <br/> undersea adventures prepared him for the sharks we often encounter in <br/> our business dealings. *rim shot*</p><br/>

                            <p> With his degree in Management Information Systems and Services, Alex is <br/> ALWAYS on top of the technology world. His engineering background and <br/> technological savvy led us to the development of an exciting new <br/> agricultural
                                delivery system which will be unveiled to potential investors in <br/> the near future. He’s always thinking, always doing something to better <br/> the process.</p><br/>

                            <p>On a personal note, I’m privileged to call Alex my business partner. I hitched <br/> my wagon to a powerful horse and he just keeps getting better and better <br/> with experience. I try to distract him once in awhile by taking
                                him to a movie <br/> or the go-cart races but our conversation ALWAYS turns back to business. <br/> He lives, breathes and loves business. I’ve learned much from this man over <br/> the past 25+ years and look forward to much
                                more success in the future. <br/> We make a great team and we hope to add you to it.

                                Concept to Harvest, we tackle these overwhelming issues just as we have in our<br/> other cannabusinesses, head on, no ifs, ands or buts. We get it done and you get the results.<br/>
